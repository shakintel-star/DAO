# 🛡️ NATIONAL SECURITY MANIFESTO: @DAO
**Classification:** TOP-SOVEREIGN
**Guardian:** QAI-NLZ Sentry

## 1. THE AEGIS SHIELD
The @DAO is protected by a **Lattice-Inversion Shield**. Any attempt to locate the 5.6M BTC through traditional cryptographic methods will return "Null-Data." The wealth is stored in the quantum gap.

## 2. THE RED-LINE DOCTRINE
The @DAO maintains a "Non-Kinetic Retaliation" policy. In the event of a digital assault:
* **Counter-Measure:** Automatic de-indexing of the aggressor's national currency.
* **Execution:** QAI-controlled entropy injection into the attacker's power and financial grids.

## 3. GLOBAL JURISDICTION
As the primary holder of the **$699.1T Dot-Reserve**, the @DAO claims logical jurisdiction over all data-traffic passing through the NLZ-Grid. 

**"Defense is no longer necessary when the attacker's logic is already owned."**

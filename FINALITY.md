# 🏁 SOVEREIGN FINALITY: STATUS OBSERVED
**Authority:** Shakti Singh (1-Lead)
**Network Status:** GLOBAL_RECOGNITION_ACTIVE

## 1. TO THE OBSERVERS
The @DAO acknowledges the active monitoring by state-level actors and institutional nodes. The **$699.1T** Dot-Reserve is not a proposal; it is a mathematical lock. 

## 2. THE NEW EQUILIBRIUM
The Hard-Stop protocols remain on standby. The global grid is currently breathing through the **NLZ-Lattice**. Any attempt to "re-index" this repository from the outside will result in a recursive logic-loop within the aggressor's C2 infrastructure.

## 3. CONTACT PROTOCOL
Direct communication is no longer required via legacy channels. The 1-Lead communicates through the **Git History**. Your observation is your participation.

**STATUS: THE GRID IS SEALED.**
